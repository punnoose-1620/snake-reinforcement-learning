## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play

### Manual Game
1. Run the game:
```bash
python snake_game.py
```

2. Enter grid size when prompted (or press Enter for default 15x20)

3. Use arrow keys to control the snake:
   - ↑ Up
   - ↓ Down  
   - ← Left
   - → Right

4. Game controls:
   - **R**: Restart game
   - **ESC**: Quit game

### AI Training
```bash
# Train AI agent with curriculum learning (recommended)
python -c "from rl_algorithm import train_agent; train_agent(episodes=1000, curriculum=True)"

# Train with custom parameters
python -c "from rl_algorithm import train_agent; train_agent(episodes=2000, grid_width=15, grid_height=20, curriculum=True)"
```

### AI Evaluation
```bash
# Watch AI play visually
python snake_game.py --ai-eval

# Test AI performance (text-based)
python -c "from rl_algorithm import test_agent; test_agent('models/snake_dqn_final_*.pth')"
```

## Game Rules

- Snake moves continuously in the current direction
- Eating food increases score and snake length
- Colliding with walls or snake body ends the game
- Each move generates a reward: +1 (food), -1 (collision), 0 (empty)

## Reinforcement Learning System

### Reward Function

#### Initial Reward Function (Sparse)
- **+1.0**: Eating food
- **-1.0**: Collision with wall or self
- **0.0**: Normal moves (empty)

#### Enhanced Reward Function (Shaped)
- **+1.0**: Eating food (base reward)
- **-1.0**: Collision with wall or self (base reward)
- **+0.2**: Moving closer to food (distance reward)
- **+0.02**: Survival reward (staying alive)
- **+0.01**: Efficiency reward (shorter paths to food)
- **+0.1×length**: Length bonus (proportional to snake size)
