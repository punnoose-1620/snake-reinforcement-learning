# Snake Game Reinforcement Learning Project Report

## Project Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning agent to play the classic Snake game. The goal is to train an AI agent that can navigate a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. The project demonstrates the application of deep reinforcement learning to a discrete action space game environment, showcasing the evolution from basic DQN implementation to an advanced system with optimized reward shaping, curriculum learning, and intelligent training termination mechanisms.

**Key Objectives:**
- Train an AI agent to play Snake game autonomously
- Achieve consistent high performance (target: >5 average score)
- Implement efficient training with smart stopping mechanisms
- Demonstrate the impact of reward engineering on learning performance

## Problem Formulation

### State Space
The state representation consists of 26 features:
- **Snake head position** (normalized x, y coordinates)
- **Food position** (normalized x, y coordinates)
- **Wall distances** (normalized distances to all four walls)
- **Food distance** (Manhattan distance and directional components)
- **Danger detection** (immediate collision risks for straight, left, right moves)
- **Direction encoding** (one-hot encoding of current movement direction)
- **Food direction** (relative position of food from snake head)
- **Snake length** (normalized by grid size)
- **Additional features** (relative food position, body density around head)

### Action Space
Discrete action space with 4 possible actions:
- 0: Move Up
- 1: Move Down  
- 2: Move Left
- 3: Move Right

### Reward Function
**Final Optimized Reward System:**
- **Food Collection**: +1.0 (primary objective)
- **Moving Toward Food**: +0.1 (directional guidance)
- **Moving Away/Same Distance**: -1.0 (discourages poor moves)
- **Collision Penalty**: -1.0 (wall or self collision)
- **Starvation Penalty**: -10.0 (episodes exceeding 200 steps without food)

### Environment Dynamics
- **Grid Size**: 15×20 (300 total cells)
- **Initial Snake**: 3 segments starting at center
- **Food Placement**: Random empty cell after consumption
- **Collision Detection**: Wall boundaries and self-intersection
- **Episode Termination**: Collision, starvation limit (200 steps), or timeout (1000 steps)
